DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING 

Optimal Substructure: A problem is said to have an optimal substructure if we can formulate a recurrence relation.

Overlapping Subproblem: A problem has an optimal substructure if we can formulate a recurrence relation for it. 


i) Top Down Approach
ii) Bottom Up Approach

The top-down approach follows the memorization technique. It consists of two distinct events: recursion and caching. 'Recursion' represents the process of computation by calling functions repeatedly, whereas 'caching' represents the storing of intermediate results.

The bottom-up approach (to dynamic programming) consists in first looking at the "smaller" subproblems, and then solve the larger subproblems using the solution to the smaller problems.
