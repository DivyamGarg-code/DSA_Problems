/* Encapsulation : kisi bhi entity ke data aur functions ko club karna that is encapsulation

 Abstraction : hiding 
 To achieve abstraction by making the properties private we can achieve abstraction as we can't access them outside the class directly
 eg inbuilt sort function, if let suppose we change the inbuilt functionality of sort function by keeping the outer structure same then also it is not affecting the end user unless and until he is getting the same output ie agar kuch improvements kiye vo reflect ho jaynge
 1. Updation/Changes without affecting end user desired output
 2. To avoid the errors : Agar let suppose sort function ko publically accessable bna diya so anyone can come and make changes in it due to which errors might be introduced .Therfore to avoid errors we have hide this function so that no third person could be able to make changes in the sort function
